Psychologie Praxisprojekt WS 2020/21

In this project we researched the effect of mindfulness-based techniques processes during the development of behavioral addictions.
More specifically, we explored the effect on gaming addiction. Based on the extensive litarture research at the beginning we concepted a german application which includes different mindfulness-based exercise, such as breathing exercises and meditation . 
All exercises were developed and recorded by our team with consideration of experience and preferences of our user group. Further we implemented the concept in a two-persons group with the platform React Native , with no prior knowledge of mobile development. 
After a succesful final presentation and promising results of Upgrade your Mind the corresponding department decided to continue the evaluation of the application at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
In several bachelor thesis, the psychological effect of using the application on the user as well as the usability were investigated.
